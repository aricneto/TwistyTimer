    // NOTE: This implementation is reasonably efficient, as it can calculate an average without
    // iterating over the array of recorded times. Iteration is only required when the known best
    // or worst values are ejected to make room for new times. Storing times in sorted order would
    // reduce this explicit iteration, but a second data structure would be required to record the
    // insertion order and the insertion operations would be more costly, as the sort order would
    // need to be maintained.
    //
    // Discarding only the single best and single worst values is standard for average-of-5
    // calculations, but for higher values of "n", it might be better to exclude, say, the best 10%
    // and worst 10%. However, that would make the implementation significantly more complicated if
    // arrays of best and worst values (or the limits of the ranges of each set of values and the
    // sums of those sets) were to be maintained. One approach might be to support calculation of
    // the median value instead, which would be relatively simple to do: sort the times, eliminate
    // the allowed DNFs and then find the time value in the middle position of the remaining times
    // in their sorted order (or the mean of the two middle values, if there are an even number of
    // remaining times).
    //
    // There are several alternative "streaming" algorithms that would not require the times to
    // be stored. However, all of those would introduce some amount of error due to rounding or
    // precision errors. As the largest value of "n" is likely to be 1,000, the approach used here
    // should be good enough and not use memory excessively.
