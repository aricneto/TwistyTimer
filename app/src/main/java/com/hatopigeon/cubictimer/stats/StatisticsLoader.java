/**
 * <p>
 * A loader used to populate a {@link Statistics} object from the database for use in the timer
 * and timer graph (statistics table) fragments. The main timer fragment will manage the listener
 * and notify its subordinate fragments of any updates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is expected that the fragment will be destroyed and recreated if the puzzle type or subtype
 * are changed. However, the fragment may also be destroyed and recreated for other reasons, such
 * as a configuration change when a user changes the device orientation. If a fragment is using
 * this loader and is destroyed and re-created in the context of the same activity, the loader
 * instance created by the previous fragment may be returned to the new fragment. If the puzzle
 * type and subtype passed to the fragment are the same, {@code LoaderManager.initLoader} can be
 * called to reuse the old loader and its loaded statistics (i.e., {@code onCreateLoader} may not
 * be called on the fragment). However, if the puzzle type or subtype have changed,
 * {@code LoaderManager.restartLoader} must be called to create a new loader with the correct
 * puzzle type and subtype, which forces a call of {@code onCreateLoader} on the fragment. It is
 * the responsibility of the fragment to call {@code initLoader} or {@code restartLoader}. If in
 * doubt, however, just call the latter method always; or the former method, but call
 * {@code LoaderManager.destroyLoader} from {@code Fragment.onDetach}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Wrapper} is required around the loaded {@code Statistics} to ensure that the loader
 * manager delivers updates via {@code onLoadFinished}. The same {@code Statistics} instance is
 * delivered each time, but the loader manager will only deliver the object if it is different
 * from the previous one delivered. Creating a new {@code Wrapper} instance around the same
 * {@code Statistics} instance for each delivery works around that behaviour.
 * </p>
