/**
 * <p>
 * A line chart renderer that can adjust the vertical positions of the text values drawn near the
 * data points. The purpose of this <i>ad hoc</i> implementation is to move the drawn text of each
 * "best time" value below its data point, rather than at its default position above the data point.
 * The problem with the default positioning is that "best" times are lowest times, so if the text
 * is drawn above the point, the line graph for "all times" will always intersect the text and make
 * it difficult to read. Placing the text below the data point avoids this problem.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This renderer is not very smart. The value of the Y-offset must be chosen based on trial and
 * error and will depend on factors such as the chosen text size, the drawing (or not) of circles
 * at the data points and the radius of those circles. None of these factors are considered by this
 * renderer, which just applies the given Y-offset. Start with offset values in the 40 to 50 range
 * and adjust things from there. However, {@link ChartStatistics#BEST_TIME_VALUES_Y_OFFSET_DP} is a
 * reasonable value for cases where the chart data sets are configured by that class.

        // Therefore, choosing a value for "mValueYOffset" depends on the circle radius and whether

        // if the text is drawn below the data point, the size of the text must also be considered
        // when choosing the value of the Y offset, as larger text must be offset more to keep the
        // top of the text below the data point.

        // Because the values are numeric, there are no descenders below the baseline (e.g., like
        // the descending loop of a lower-case "g"). To prevent the value text being drawn if it
        // touches or crosses the bottom horizontal axis, simply guard the call to "super.drawValue"

        // this bounds-checking, it looks quite nice: drawing the text outside the axis until the
        // point itself touches the axis. Zoom in and drag the chart around to experiment.
